# Problems
* Currently, **the processing & analysis** the employees data has been **largely manual to filter the eligibility** of employees for promotion, and this **leads to delay** in transition to the new roles after promotion
* With a large time and manual process, processing & analysis are also **may be less accurate**

# Purposes
**Reduce the flow** of processing & analysis **to filter the eligibility** of employees with a **more automated process & more accurate**

# Early Insight from The Data
1. Distribution of Promoted Employees is not Balanced
2. Employees who achieved their KPIs >80% have higher probabilities to get promotion
3. Employees with award(s) also have the higher chance to get promotion
4. Uniquely, employees with average training score is >=90 almost all of them get promotion
5. Higher the rating, higher the chance to get promotion
